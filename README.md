# Discord-Rce-Exploit
COMING SOON
<br>
<p>The rce uses images that are sent through discord with code inside of them. The code is detected by most if not all antivirus's on windows 7-10.<br>
The code inside the image must always include the code inside this .vb then whatever code you would like to execute.<br>
<br>
: How it works?<br>
When an image is sent through discord, it gets cached into discords folder on the victim(s) computer.<br>
Inside the image will be detected code that gets picked up and ran by the anti-virus <br>
<br>
^^^ This is not the rce, it will be explained more below<br>
<br>
Most if not all anti-viruses run detected files in an sanbox on your machine. <br>
(Which is why when you download or have more files on your computer, your anti-virus uses more system resources)<br>
This rce exploit breaks outside of that sanbox and executes the code straight to the "core". (Core is what we shall call the computer)<br>
<br>
That explains a little on how this rce works.<br>
Although we are not executing code straight through discord, this is the only way i have found to do any sort of code execution VIA discord so far.<br>
<br>
Now this exploit isnt perfect at all. <br>
There are many pros and cons to it.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
The exploit can not be patched via discord unless they stop caching or disallow sending files with edited metacode (Impossible tbh)<br>
The exploit is completly hidden and and can be executed onto an entire server, group dm or just a single user.<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
Only works for windows 7-10 currently<br>
Can be patched client sided very easily<br>
<br>
This repository will be updated soon if i deside to make it public or wait until it gets patched.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, discord is an unsafe client. Pretty sure we all knew this already<br>
