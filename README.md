# Discord-Rce-Exploit
COMING SOON
The rce uses images that are sent through discord with code inside of them. 
The code is detected by most if not all antivirus's on windows 7-10.
The code inside the image must always include the code inside this .vb then whatever code you would like to execute.

: How it works?

When an image is sent through discord, it gets cached into discords folder on the victim(s) computer.

Inside the image will be detected code that gets picked up and ran by the anti-virus 

^^^ This is not the rce, it will be explained more below

Most if not all anti-viruses run detected files in an sanbox on your machine. 

(Which is why when you download or have more files on your computer, your anti-virus uses more system resources)

This rce exploit breaks outside of that sanbox and executes the code straight to the "core". (Core is what we shall call the computer)

That explains a little on how this rce works.

Although we are not executing code straight through discord, this is the only way i have found to do any sort of code execution VIA discord so far.

Now this exploit isnt perfect at all.

There are many pros and cons to it.

Pros:

The exploit can not be patched via discord unless they stop caching or disallow sending files with edited metacode (Impossible tbh)

The exploit is completly hidden and and can be executed onto an entire server, group dm or just a single user.

Cons:

Only works for windows 7-10 currently

Can be patched client sided very easily

This repository will be updated soon if i deside to make it public or wait until it gets patched.

Furthermore, discord is an unsafe client. Pretty sure we all knew this already
